# Creating Administrator Account

When you access Axibase Collector for the first time, you will be prompted to configure a built-in administrator account.

We recommend setting up this account as part of the installation process:

1. Open Axibase Collector web interface at https://hostname:9443.
2. Enter username and password for the administrator account.
3. Click Save.
4. Re-login into Axibase Collector as administrator
