The State of Iowa operates on a modified accrual basis which provides that encumbrances on June 30 must be paid within 60 days after year end. The Legislature may enact exceptions to this statute and usually do so for capital items which may run for several years.\r\n\r\nDepartment names and budget units for FY 2010 - 2015 are based on names used in FY 2016. |

| Description | Data are provided by the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA). This data set includes total trips taken by bus, metro, rail, and mobility/paratransit services. Beginning in FY2014, the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) began counting Core Bus ridership using an Automated Passenger Count (APC) system to better track the number of people boarding and leaving the buses. In order to maintain the integrity of historical comparisons for the Transit Ridership Goal, the MTA used ridership estimate differences between the new APC system and previous counting estimates for its Bus Service to allow for apples-to-apples comparisons between fiscal years. |

### Accidental Drug Related Deaths 2012-2015

| Name | Accidental Drug Related Deaths  2012-2015 |
| State | [Connecticut](https://data.ct.gov) |
| Description | A listing of each accidental death associated with drug overdose in Connecticut from 2012 to 2015. A "Y" value under the different substance columns indicates that particular substance was detected.Data are derived from an investigation by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner which includes the toxicity report, death certificate, as well as a scene investigation.The “Morphine (Not Heroin)” values are related to the differences between how Morphine and Heroin are metabolized and therefor detected in the toxicity results. Heroin metabolizes to 6-MAM which then metabolizes to morphine.  6-MAM is unique to heroin, and has a short half-life (as does heroin itself). Thus, in some heroin deaths, the toxicity results will not indicate whether the morphine is from heroin or prescription morphine. In these cases the Medical Examiner may be able to determine the cause based on the scene investigation (such as  finding heroin needles). If they find prescription morphine at the scene it is certified as “Morphine (not heroin).” The refor, the Cause of Death may indicate Morphine, but the Heroin or Morphine (Not Heroin) may not be indicated.“Any Opioid” – If the Medical Examiner cannot conclude whether it’s RX Morphine or heroin based morphine in the toxicity results, that column may be checked |
